# Faceless

The "RNGebus" entry to Porto Graphic's 2015 GameJam. Theme: Glitch

Exploration game that it is still unfinished (ending missing). Move around the house with arrows keys and use spacebar to entry doors and go up/down the stairs. There are 3 items to pick up, that will appear as you explore the house, in other to open the door to the attic and see the real form of the "glitch" that is chasing you. We recomend this game is played with headphones and some volume.
